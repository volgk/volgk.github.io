# Foreword

So, my favorite thing to do is to eat. And, as you know, it's not the most profitable
occupation, but quite the opposite. So I decided to go to IT. And this is what happened.

# Chapter I

I knew nothing about computers or programs. My limit was to run in Windows the error recovery. When I first saw the terminal, I thought it was magic. I wanted to be a magician too. So I start with Ubuntu and Python.

## [mich](https://github.com/volgk/mich)

Write a program that will allow the user to change the IP or MAC at his discretion.

My first task.

My friend thought it was a good idea to give such a simple task to a FULL NOOB. I asked how long it would take him to solve it. When he said for two hours, I calmed down. Pfff! I already knew how to print "Hello world!" with python, I knew loops and variables. And several commands in the terminal. What could go wrong?

I wrote mich for two months. I've learned a lot of new things. For example, about the Internet and how it works. About IP and MAC, Internet Protocols, ISO model layers. I learned to google. I turned out that I didn't google correctly.

I tempered my ardor. It was not what I expected. Where is the magic? What I wanted was tap-tap-tap on the keyboard and voila, a beautiful working program. I was naive and stupid.

But! But. I realized that no matter how much I know, this will always be not enough. It's not bad too.

## [qrot](https://github.com/non-yellow-spot/qrot)

A simple OSINT tool.

I wrote mich with difficulty, and not without help. I couldn't have done it on my own. It was clear that I didn't know much and started programming early.

So I downloaded SoloLearn from Google Play and took all the Python courses. I received a certificate in pdf for passing that. Then, I solved the first practical task from there, during the day. And I was satisfied with myself. My time has come! The programs can't write themselves.

I know what you're thinking. But I couldn't do otherwise. I wanted to become a programmer as soon as possible, and write already real, useful programs, not all these "Hello world!". Sometimes we have to hit high branches, that the next time we put your head down. Sometimes it happens more often than we would like.

So, my friend suggested to write qrot together. Of all the code that I wrote, remain only URLs. The thing is, I wrote the code in Python, and everything was great until it was rejected as unnecessary. My friend praised me for a job well done, but also, he mercilessly deleted my lines. They are superfluous, he said. Damned branches...
