# Foreword

So, my favorite thing to do is to eat. And, as you know, it's not the most profitable
occupation, but quite the opposite. So I decided to go to IT. And this is what happened.


# Chapter I

I knew nothing about computers or programs. My limit was to run in Windows the error recovery. When I first saw the terminal, I thought it was magic. I wanted to be a magician too. So I start with Ubuntu and Python.


## [mich](https://github.com/volgk/mich)

Write a program that will allow the user to change the IP or MAC at his discretion.
---
My first task.

My friend thought it was a good idea to give such a simple task to a FULL NOOB. I asked how long it would take him to solve it. When he said for two hours, I calmed down. Pfff! I already knew how to print "Hello world!" with python, I knew loops and variables. And several commands in the terminal. What could go wrong?

I wrote mich for two months. I've learned a lot of new things. For example, about the Internet and how it works. About IP and MAC, Internet Protocols, ISO model layers. I learned to google. I turned out that I didn't google correctly.

I tempered my ardor. It was not what I expected. Where is the magic? What I wanted was tap-tap-tap on the keyboard and voila, a beautiful working program. I was naive and stupid.

But! But. I realized that no matter how much I know, this will always be not enough. It's not bad too.


## [qrot](https://github.com/volgk/qrot)

A simple OSINT tool.
---

I wrote mich with difficulty, and not without help. I couldn't have done it on my own. It was clear that I didn't know much and started programming early.

So I downloaded SoloLearn from Google Play and took all the Python courses. I received a certificate in pdf for passing that. Then, I solved the first practical task from there, during the day. And I was satisfied with myself. My time has come! The programs can't write themselves.

I know what you're thinking. But I couldn't do otherwise. I wanted to become a programmer as soon as possible, and write already real, useful programs, not all these "Hello world!". Sometimes we have to hit high branches, that the next time we put your head down. Sometimes it happens more often than we would like.

So, my friend suggested to write qrot together. He wrote it on perl, and me on Python. Of all the code that I wrote, unchanged remain only URLs. Everything was great until it was rejected as unnecessary. My friend praised me for a job well done, but also, he mercilessly deleted my lines. They are superfluous, he said. Damned branches...

And he was right. My code was redundant ugly, useless, but working. I was jealous of my friend's ability to KNOW how to write short and beautiful code. It was so simple and so far from my way of thinking.

I went back again to the fact that there was little knowledge, little practice, and little
experience. And that I will accumulate all this, but over time, definitely not on the second
attempt.

Going forward, I will mention that now, I use Python as an auxiliary tool in achieving various goals such as wireless pentesting. [There](https://github.com/volgk/handy_scrips) are a couple of Python scripts.


# Chapter II


## Switching: Ethical hacking and Linux

Since the relationship with Python did not go well, I decided to switch. I exchanged Ubuntu for Kali Linux, and I discovered new opportunities for myself. Pentesting is so exciting! I began to delve deeper into ethical hacking and why it is different from a real hack.

Read, and read again,so boring. I want to practice! On the net, you can find many platforms that offer to pass their pen-test tasks to study and test yourself. So, I opened the first one and started solving it. There was a field for the password, and apparently, I had to find it. I had been struggling to think of the problem for a long time, 20 minutes! And in the end, I've stolen the solution on forums. There was a comment in the source code, something like: "Password: password, P.S.: If first thing, you didn't look the source code, you don't belong here."

Okay, I get it. I closed the tab and started reading about the "OWASP Top Ten Security Vulnerabilities". When I got tired of reading, I turned on video tutorials on Kali Linux and ethical hacking. I thoughtlessly repeated what they said in instructions, and was sincerely happy when something suddenly worked. My friend shook his head at my attempts, and one day he told me about "script-kiddie".

It was me, each word was about me. I was like a monkey with a grenade, threw requests to
everything that accepts them. Since I learned to send requests from Python... I understood that I need to dig deeper, but I could not know how deep. I was afraid to get lost in the abundance of information, and as a result, to know what is not useful.


## Void Linux

I realized that my tactics were initially wrong. So I decided to start from the beginning:
What is Linux? I did not know. I used it for a year, but, as a true script-kiddie, did not know how it works. I thought that people faster learn to swim already in the middle of the pool, so I switched to Void Linux. Of course, my friend helped me set everything up because I sat in front of a black terminal for a week and happily shouted when it turned out to change the font or the color of the letters. It was fun but looked pathetic.

And again, I discovered a lot of new things. For example, I learned how to set up awesome,
certainly not like in [UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/), but I enjoyed the
process. When I got used to it, my friend suggested that it would be nice if I knew the 
Linux system at a lower level. And offered a choice between Gentoo and Crux. "I use Crux. 
If you choose it, I can help you. If you choose Gentoo, you will figure it out by
yourself." he said. 


## Gentoo

This turned out to be another chance to prove that I worth something. After all, to 
understand is not the same as to create. Someone has already done everything 
before you. "If there is logic, I'll understand it." - I said and chose Gentoo.

I read the handbook and blindly followed the instructions. As always in such cases, there 
were cries of joy when something worked out and worth of misery when not. The hardest thing was to deal with the settings. For example, I set up the touchpad for two days.
I rummaged all the Internet in search of the solution. On the second day, my friend came up 
to me and pressed 'Fn+F7', and it worked. There were many such situations. I didn't 
remember all of them. The devil is in the details. Due to my inexperience, I 
couldn't know about them in any way.

I began to read the instructions more carefully because everything was there from the very
beginning. I found out that any problem has steps to solve, and someone smart has already 
written about it. And also, the correct question raised contains the answer.

Since the initial view of Gentoo is 'naked' - I hated the pages where they offered to solve 
my problem by putting a tick in the indicated menu window. Hey, I'm trying to start Xs 
here! What the hell is a menu?! Give me the answer in the console version! And yes, I loved 
the minimalism of the console. It is neat and beautiful, especially when I change 
everything how I like and work for my own pleasure. Until now, fiddling with the appearance 
of the system takes me a week. Can't pick a color or something like that.

So, studying the unknown, I came across packages. What it was, I vaguely imagined. But 
where they come from, and why they are? I didn't ask such questions. My friend asked me. 
And I thought about it. I remembered how many times I needed a utility and it was 
not there. Or how many times the build of package broke. How to fix it then? And if you fix 
it, how to let the other know about the fix? So I grew up to packages and patches. 
I've grown up to read about them, of course.


## Crux

The first impulse was to see how it works in Gentoo. For comparison, my friend suggested 
looking at Slackware and Crux's packages. Nerds, I thought, trying to understand 
something in SlackBuilds. It was beautiful, but not for me - a newbie. In Gentoo it was 
easier. I tried to build something independently, but alas, no place for miracle. Crux 
amazed me with his simplicity, not only in packages but in everything. It became so easy to 
read configs and to UNDERSTAND them. We (my friend and I) compared the rc-scripts for 
dhcpcd in Gentoo and Crux. The favorite was obvious. And it was also obvious that my OS 
would change again. I'm so impetuous. Probably because I'm a girl.

As always in my case, going to Crux, I did not learn how to install it. Not the first time 
for sure. Just like in other cases, when I undertook to study something, I mastered
different things from what has planned. At my disposal was a little Crux 
handbook, a wonderful one must say. Many things, obvious for somebody, have been overlooked 
as that everyone already knows. But not me. All Linux forums have become my best friends. 
Gentoo, Pentoo, Void Linux, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Kali Linux. I learned to collect 
information regardless of the source and dispose of it according to my needs. For example, 
I was pleasantly surprised by the [Ubuntu Sound Troubleshooting](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshootingProcedure). Although who would have guessed such a detailed 
instruction in Ubuntu? And no screenshots or checkmarks!

I'm steel on Crux and I love it. During all these changes, I continued to study ethical hacking.
Since Crux is synonymous with minimalism and isn't made for pentest, I learned to port
cyber-friendly packages. Together with my friend support a repository [here](https://github.com/non-yellow-spot/vccrux).
As for the pentest, I've done all the easy tasks from hacker101 CTF. Cool, yeah?

# Chapter III


## [The road to Kali Nethunter](https://github.com/volgk/The-road-to-Kali-Nethunter)

Then one day, my phone broke.

Actually, it all started when I lost it. But fools are lucky, so a day later a good woman founded
and returned it to me. Until then, I've been keeping track of plans to prevent such situations.
By opening remote access to my phone, of course! So when I got it back, I started looking for a way
to do it. 

It was unexpected to find out that I'm not a root in my phone (thank God I already knew what root
was). Thus the task was to root it. There was a lot of information, so I quickly figured it out -
it's a hard work here and not that simple. For example: How to flush a ZIP file on the phone?
I had no idea. Without a complete understanding of what I'm doing (as always), I was following steps from 
different instructions. So to speak, there was no sign of trouble, but the phone broke.

If memory serves, I uploaded the wrong file to the wrong partition. I was almost sad. My friend
was jubilant. "You had nothing to lose now, so experiment" - he said. And I tried everything I've found.
It was long few days of continuous failure. And I would give up after the first day, but I needed a
working phone. I guess that's what made me go over the habit of dropping the case halfway. And I
brought him back to life! That was so wonderful since I did it myself. My always helping friend
was helpless (he knew as much as I did). My success has turned my head, but not for long. An hour later I
was bored. My friend suggested turning the telephone into a hacker phone since I already know how to
fix it.

So began my journey to Kali NetHunter. Remembering all the problems I faced, I wrote down all my
steps. Again, a lot was supposed to know when reading those instructions. It was hard to deepen of every 
little thing by myself, so I decided to share my difficulties with noobs like me.
I learned a lot of new. For example: about recovering partition and how
to install it; the download mode and what it is intended for; the kernel of my phone is based on
Linux (!), of course I learned to build a working one; learned how to flash kernels with different ways; 
noted the similarity and the distinctions between phone Linux and PC Linux; learned to work with different 
utilities: Heimdall, Odin, SDK-utils. It was an interesting two months.

# Chapter IV

## The proper training: Hacking: the Art of Exploitation

My path as a hacker was not very smooth (still is). I completed the easy tasks from hacker101 CTF
but yielded to more difficult ones. I can found vulnerabilities, but I didn't know how to
exploit them. So I decided to change my tactics.

I found the book "Hacking: The art of exploitation" by Jon Erickson and began to study. [Here](https://
github.com/volgk/hacking-the-art-of-exploitation) is the practical part of the book, where I performed 
tasks and left my notes. But I didn't finish the book, for several reasons. 

In the book, all practice was performed on some kind of dinosaur with 32-bit OS. I thought it would 
be a challenge to learn hacking 32-bit computers in the 21st century. Also, I saw no problem in translating 
all in today's 64-bit realities. As it turned out after two-three chapters, I was wrong. Much of 
what is described, cannot be repeated on a conventionally modern machine since smart people have fixed it 
all. For example, I had to disable the protection against stack overflows in the compiler to 
simulate the vulnerability, and my exploitable code worked "as it should".

Another problem was the critical lack of knowledge about computer memory and what goes on there. All
these "little-endian", registers (which differ at least in name from those on 32-bit machines) and
stacks drove me crazy.

Then the problem of not knowing the C language surfaced. At first, it was not difficult to understand
what was going on in the code. But as the program became more complex, I caught myself on the fact
that I did not understand what I was writing and executing.

From all of the above, a logical course of events followed: I did not succeed in much. If you
follow my notes, you can track the exponential growth of my despair. I slowly realized that a lot is
passing me by just because I haven't grown up to such books. So I admitted defeat in front of this
book and started looking for something for dummies. I didn't delete the book repository because ...
shame on me - that's why. And nothing motivates me to succeed like an unforgettable, publicly
exposed shame.

While reading the book, I made a list of what, in my opinion, I need or want to know. It included:
	* Computer memory and how it works
	* Programming Language C and low-level programming
	* Algorithms and data structures
	* Assembly and Reverse engineering
A lot, right? And only to understand the damn hacking book. But I felt it was the right
way. Reading books on getting smarter, who would have thought...

## The proper training: C Programming Language

I started with ["Programming in C: A complete introduction to the C programming language" Stephen
G. Kochan, Third Edition](https://github.com/volgk/programming_in_C). And I enjoyed solving
problems. In the beginning, they were easy, but in the end, I spend weeks solving one of them. I know,
I know, for someone, weeks can seem a too long time for such tasks. Keep in mind that, most likely, you
are more experienced and smarter than me, so I can do that. The tasks were difficult for me, but I
did not give up. My perseverance paid off with emotion when, finally, the decision illuminates me.
I was happy with my little victory, jumping around the house chanting "Hurray, I did it!".

When I finished the basic course, I imagined myself a guru in C. After so much effort, it couldn't
be otherwise. Until I came across data structures and algorithms...
(Astonished, desperate, doomed pause) my life won't be enough to figure this shit out...

My friend says that I don't need to know all of them, only basic ones. Man, these basic ones are
enough to kill me!
But there is nothing to do, I still wanted (and now want), not just to do, but to do better. And for
this, I need to dive deeper into data structures and algorithms. I started with "Grokking Algorithms"
by Aditya Y. Bhargava. [Here](https://github.com/volgk/data_structures_in_C) are the structures
I tried to implement.
