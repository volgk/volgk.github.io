# Foreword

So, my favorite thing to do is to eat. And, as you know, it's not the most profitable
occupation, but quite the opposite. So I decided to go to IT. And this is what happened.

# Chapter I

I knew nothing about computers or programs. My limit was to run in Windows the error recovery. When I first saw the terminal, I thought it was magic. I wanted to be a magician too. So I start with Ubuntu and Python.

## [MICH](https://github.com/volgk/mich)

Write a program that will allow the user to change the IP or MAC at his discretion.

My first task.

My friend thought it was a good idea to give such a simple task to a FULL NOOB. I asked how long it would take him to solve it. When he said for two hours, I calmed down. Pfff! I already knew how to print "Hello world!" with python, I knew loops and variables. And several commands in the terminal. What could go wrong?

I wrote mich for two months. I've learned a lot of new things. For example, about the Internet and how it works. About IP and MAC, Internet Protocols, ISO model layers. I learned to google. I turned out that I didn't google correctly.
I tempered my ardor. It was not what I expected. Where is the magic? What I wanted was tap-tap-tap on the keyboard and voila, a beatiful working program. I was naive and stupid.

But! But. I realized that no matter how much I know, this will always be not enough. It's not bad too.
