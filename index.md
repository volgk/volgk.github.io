# Foreword

So, my favorite thing to do is to eat. And, as you know, it's not the most profitable
occupation, but quite the opposite. So I decided to go to IT. And this is what happened.

# Chapter I

I knew nothing about computers or programs. My limit was to run in Windows the error recovery. When I first saw the terminal, I thought it was magic. I wanted to be a magician too. So I start with Ubuntu and Python.

## [mich](https://github.com/volgk/mich)

Write a program that will allow the user to change the IP or MAC at his discretion.
---
My first task.

My friend thought it was a good idea to give such a simple task to a FULL NOOB. I asked how long it would take him to solve it. When he said for two hours, I calmed down. Pfff! I already knew how to print "Hello world!" with python, I knew loops and variables. And several commands in the terminal. What could go wrong?

I wrote mich for two months. I've learned a lot of new things. For example, about the Internet and how it works. About IP and MAC, Internet Protocols, ISO model layers. I learned to google. I turned out that I didn't google correctly.

I tempered my ardor. It was not what I expected. Where is the magic? What I wanted was tap-tap-tap on the keyboard and voila, a beautiful working program. I was naive and stupid.

But! But. I realized that no matter how much I know, this will always be not enough. It's not bad too.

## [qrot](https://github.com/non-yellow-spot/qrot)

A simple OSINT tool.
---

I wrote mich with difficulty, and not without help. I couldn't have done it on my own. It was clear that I didn't know much and started programming early.

So I downloaded SoloLearn from Google Play and took all the Python courses. I received a certificate in pdf for passing that. Then, I solved the first practical task from there, during the day. And I was satisfied with myself. My time has come! The programs can't write themselves.

I know what you're thinking. But I couldn't do otherwise. I wanted to become a programmer as soon as possible, and write already real, useful programs, not all these "Hello world!". Sometimes we have to hit high branches, that the next time we put your head down. Sometimes it happens more often than we would like.

So, my friend suggested to write qrot together. He wrote it on perl, and me on Python. Of all the code that I wrote, unchanged remain only URLs. Everything was great until it was rejected as unnecessary. My friend praised me for a job well done, but also, he mercilessly deleted my lines. They are superfluous, he said. Damned branches...

And he was right. My code was redundant ugly, useless, but working. I was jealous of my friend's ability to KNOW how to write short and beautiful code. It was so simple and so far from my way of thinking.

I went back again to the fact that there was little knowledge, little practice, and little
experience. And that I will accumulate all this, but over time, definitely not on the second
attempt.

Going forward, I will mention that now, I use Python as an auxiliary tool in achieving various goals such as wireless pentesting. [There](https://github.com/volgk/handy_scrips) are a couple of Python scripts.

## Switching: Ethical hacking and Linux

Since the relationship with Python did not go well, I decided to switch. I exchanged Ubuntu for Kali Linux, and I discovered new opportunities for myself. Pentesting is so exciting! I began to delve deeper into ethical hacking and why it is different from a real hack.

Read, and read again,so boring. I want to practice! On the net, you can find many platforms that offer to pass their pen-test tasks to study and test yourself. So, I opened the first one and started solving it. There was a field for the password, and apparently, I had to find it. I had been struggling to think of the problem for a long time, 20 minutes! And in the end, I've stolen the solution on forums. There was a comment in the source code, something like: "Password: password, P.S.: If first thing, you didn't look the source code, you don't belong here."

Okay, I get it. I closed the tab and started reading about the "OWASP Top Ten Security Vulnerabilities". When I got tired of reading, I turned on video tutorials on Kali Linux and ethical hacking. I thoughtlessly repeated what they said in instructions, and was sincerely happy when something suddenly worked. My friend shook his head at my attempts, and one day he told me about "script-kiddie".

It was me, each word was about me. I was like a monkey with a grenade, threw requests to
everything that accepts them. Since I learned to send requests from Python... I understood that I need to dig deeper, but I could not know how deep. I was afraid to get lost in the abundance of information, and as a result, to know what is not useful.

I realized that my tactics were initially wrong. So I decided to start from the beginning:
What is Linux? I did not know. I used it for a year, but, as a true script-kiddie, did not know how it works. I thought that people faster learn to swim already in the middle of the pool, so I switched to Void Linux. Of course, my friend helped me set everything up because I sat in front of a black terminal for a week and happily shouted when it turned out to change the font or the color of the letters. It was fun but looked pathetic.
